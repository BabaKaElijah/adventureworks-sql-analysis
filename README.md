## üì¶ Dataset Overview: AdventureWorksDW2022

`AdventureWorksDW2022` is the **latest version** of Microsoft‚Äôs sample data warehouse designed for learning and testing Business Intelligence (BI), data warehousing, and analytical reporting solutions.

### üè≠ The Story Behind the Data
Adventure Works is a **fictional bicycle manufacturing company**. The dataset represents the data warehouse side of the business ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs already cleaned, transformed, and structured using a **star schema** typical of enterprise BI systems.

The dataset includes facts and dimensions around:

- **Sales performance** (FactInternetSales, FactResellerSales)
- **Product details** (DimProduct, DimProductSubcategory, DimProductCategory)
- **Customer demographics** (DimCustomer, DimGeography)
- **Dates and time intelligence** (DimDate)
- **Employees and resellers** (DimEmployee, DimReseller)
- **Financial metrics** (sales amount, product cost, profit)

### ‚≠ê Schema Style
The data warehouse uses a **star schema**:
- Central **fact tables** (e.g., FactInternetSales) record measurable events.
- Surrounding **dimension tables** (e.g., DimProduct, DimCustomer, DimDate) provide descriptive context.

This setup supports fast, efficient analytical queries ‚Äî exactly the kind we use in this project.

## üìä Business Questions Answered

The following analysis questions were tackled using `SQL Server` and `AdventureWorksDW2022`:
1. For each customer who made a purchase, show their full name and their total internet sales amount.
```sql
SELECT 
  c.FirstName + ' ' + c.LastName AS FullName,
  SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM FactInternetSales f
JOIN DimCustomer c ON f.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey
GROUP BY c.FirstName, c.LastName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```
2. Use a CTE to find the average internet sales amount per product. Show the product name and the average sales amount, sorted by highest average first.
```sql
WITH AvgSales AS (
  SELECT 
    ProductKey,
    AVG(SalesAmount) AS AvgSale
  FROM FactInternetSales
  GROUP BY ProductKey
)

SELECT 
  p.EnglishProductName,
  a.AvgSale
FROM AvgSales a
JOIN DimProduct p ON a.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
ORDER BY a.AvgSale DESC;
```
3. Show internet sales per month, and calculate: Total sales for the current month. Previous month's sales. Growth (difference between months).
```sql
SELECT 
  d.CalendarYear,
  d.EnglishMonthName,
  d.MonthNumberOfYear,
  SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS CurrentMonthSales,

  -- Previous month's total sales
  LAG(SUM(f.SalesAmount)) OVER (
    ORDER BY d.CalendarYear, d.MonthNumberOfYear
  ) AS PreviousMonthSales,

  SUM(f.SalesAmount) - LAG(SUM(f.SalesAmount)) OVER (
    ORDER BY d.CalendarYear, d.MonthNumberOfYear
  ) AS Growth
FROM FactInternetSales f
JOIN DimDate d ON f.OrderDateKey = d.DateKey
GROUP BY d.CalendarYear, d.EnglishMonthName, d.MonthNumberOfYear
ORDER BY d.CalendarYear, d.MonthNumberOfYear;
```
4. Calculate Rolling 3-Month Average Sales per Product.
```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
  SELECT 
    p.ProductKey,
    p.EnglishProductName,
    d.CalendarYear,
    d.MonthNumberOfYear,
    SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
  FROM FactInternetSales f
  JOIN DimProduct p ON f.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
  JOIN DimDate d ON f.OrderDateKey = d.DateKey
  GROUP BY 
    p.ProductKey,
    p.EnglishProductName,
    d.CalendarYear,
    d.MonthNumberOfYear
)

SELECT
  ProductKey,
  EnglishProductName,
  CalendarYear,
  MonthNumberOfYear,
  TotalSales,

  -- Rolling 3-month average including current and previous 2 months
  AVG(TotalSales) OVER (
    PARTITION BY ProductKey
    ORDER BY CalendarYear, MonthNumberOfYear
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS Rolling3MonthAvg
FROM MonthlySales
ORDER BY ProductKey, CalendarYear, MonthNumberOfYear;
```
5. Top 3 Customers by Sales in Each Year.
```sql
WITH CustomerYearlySales AS (
SELECT 
c.FirstName + ' ' + c.LastName AS FullName,
c.CustomerKey,
d.CalendarYear,
SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
PARTITION BY d.CalendarYear
ORDER BY SUM(f.SalesAmount) DESC
) AS SalesRank
FROM FactInternetSales f
JOIN DimCustomer c ON f.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey
JOIN DimDate d ON f.OrderDateKey = d.DateKey
GROUP BY d.CalendarYear, c.CustomerKey, c.FirstName, c.LastName
)
SELECT *
FROM CustomerYearlySales
WHERE SalesRank <= 3
ORDER BY CalendarYear, SalesRank;
```
6. Identify products where total monthly sales declined for 3 months in a row.
```sql
WITH MonthlyProductSales AS (
  SELECT
    p.ProductKey,
    p.EnglishProductName,
    d.CalendarYear,
    d.MonthNumberOfYear,
    CAST(CONCAT(d.CalendarYear, '-', RIGHT('0' + CAST(d.MonthNumberOfYear AS VARCHAR(2)), 2)) AS DATE) AS SaleMonth,
    SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS MonthlySales
  FROM FactInternetSales f
  JOIN DimDate d ON f.OrderDateKey = d.DateKey
  JOIN DimProduct p ON f.ProductKey = p.ProductKey
  GROUP BY p.ProductKey, p.EnglishProductName, d.CalendarYear, d.MonthNumberOfYear
),
WithLaggedSales AS (
  SELECT *,
    LAG(MonthlySales, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductKey ORDER BY CalendarYear, MonthNumberOfYear) AS Prev1,
    LAG(MonthlySales, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductKey ORDER BY CalendarYear, MonthNumberOfYear) AS Prev2
  FROM MonthlyProductSales
)
SELECT
  ProductKey,
  EnglishProductName,
  CalendarYear,
  MonthNumberOfYear,
  MonthlySales AS CurrentMonthSales,
  Prev1 AS LastMonthSales,
  Prev2 AS TwoMonthsAgoSales
FROM WithLaggedSales

  FROM CountrySales
)
SELECT 
  cs.Country,
  cs.TotalSales,
  ROUND(cs.TotalSales * 100.0 / ts.GrandTotal, 2) AS SalesPercentage
FROM CountrySales cs
CROSS JOIN TotalSales ts
ORDER BY SalesPercentage DESC;
```
8. Identify the top 10 most profitable customers based on total profit.

## üß† SQL Techniques Used

This project makes extensive use of **advanced SQL concepts**, including:

- ‚úÖ CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
  Used for breaking down complex logic into readable layers.

- ‚úÖ Window Functions (`RANK()`, `LAG()`)  
  Used for ranking entities and calculating changes over time.

- ‚úÖ Aggregate Functions (`SUM()`, `ROUND()`)  
  Used for summarizing sales, cost, and profit data.

- ‚úÖ Multi-level Joins  
  Navigated through star schema relationships (e.g., Product ‚Üí Subcategory ‚Üí Category).

- ‚úÖ Data Transformation  
  Performed dynamic calculations like profit margins and percentage contributions.

- ‚úÖ Filtering & Ordering  
  Used `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` for targeted, organized results.
